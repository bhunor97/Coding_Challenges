    <!-- You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be
    very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of
    odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single
    integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns
    this "outlier" N. Examples [2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36] Should return: 11
    (the only odd number) [160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21] Should return: 160
    (the only even number) -->
