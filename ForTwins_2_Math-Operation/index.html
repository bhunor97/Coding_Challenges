    <!-- A magician in the subway showed you a trick, he put an ice brick in a bottle
    to impress you. The brick's width and height are equal, forming a square.
    Just for fun and also to impress the magician and people around, you decided
    to calculate the brick's volume. Write a function iceBrickVolume that will
    accept these parameters: radius - bottle's radius (always > 0); bottleLength
    - total bottle length (always > 0); rimLength - length from bottle top to
    brick (always < bottleLength); And return volume of ice brick that magician
    managed to put into a bottle. All inputs are integers. Assume no
    irregularities to the cuboid brick. You may assume the bottle is shaped like
    a cylinder. The brick cannot fit inside the rim. All inputs are integers. -->
