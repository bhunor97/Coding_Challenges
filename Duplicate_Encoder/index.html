    <!-- The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each
    character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in
    the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the
    original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a
    duplicate. Examples "din" => "(((" "recede" => "()()()" "Success" =>
    ")())())" "(( @" => "))((" Notes Assertion messages may be unclear about
    what they display in some languages. If you read "...It Should encode XXX",
    the "XXX" is the expected result, not the input! -->
