    <!-- Your car is old, it breaks easily. The shock absorbers are gone and you
    think it can handle about 15 more bumps before it dies totally.
    Unfortunately for you, your drive is very bumpy! Given a string showing
    either flat road ("_") or bumps ("n"), work out if you make it home safely.
    15 bumps or under, return "Woohoo!", over 15 bumps return "Car Dead". -->
