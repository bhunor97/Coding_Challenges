    <!-- The goal of this Kata is to reduce the passed integer to a single digit (if
    not already) by converting the number to binary, taking the sum of the
    binary digits, and if that sum is not a single digit then repeat the
    process. If the passed integer is already a single digit there is no need to
    reduce n will be an integer such that 0 < n < 10⁹ For example given 5665 the
