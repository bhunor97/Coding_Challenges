    Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer. An integer is a
    palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is a
    palindrome while 123 is not. Example 1: Input: x = 121 Output: true
    Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
    Example 2: Input: x = -121 Output: false Explanation: From left to right, it
    reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a
    palindrome. Example 3: Input: x = 10 Output: false Explanation: Reads 01
    from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome. Constraints: -231 <= x
    <= 231 - 1 Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a
    string?
