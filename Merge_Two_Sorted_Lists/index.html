    <title>21. Merge Two Sorted Lists</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2. Merge
    the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing
    together the nodes of the first two lists. Return the head of the merged
    linked list. Example 1: Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4] Output:
    [1,1,2,3,4,4] Example 2: Input: list1 = [], list2 = [] Output: [] Example 3:
    Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0] Output: [0] Constraints: The number of nodes
    in both lists is in the range [0, 50]. -100 <= Node.val <= 100 Both list1
    and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order. -->
