    <!-- Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which
    subtracts one list from another and returns the result. It should remove all
    values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.
    arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2] If a value is present in b, all of its
    occurrences must be removed from the other: arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) ==
    [1,3] -->
