    <!-- Complete the method that returns true if 2 integers share at least two 1
    bits, otherwise return false. For simplicity assume that all numbers are
    non-negative. Examples 7 = 0111 in binary 10 = 1010 15 = 1111 7 and 10 share
    only a single 1-bit (at index 2) --- false 7 and 15 share 3 1-bits (at
    indexes 1, 2, and 3) --- true 10 and 15 share 2 1-bits (at indexes 0 and 2)
    --- true Hint: you can do this with just string manipulation, but binary
    operators will make your life much easier. -->
