    <!-- You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character
    of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If
    the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters. #Examples:
    Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es" Kata.getMiddle("testing") should
    return "t" Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd" Kata.getMiddle("A")
    should return "A" #Input A word (string) of length 0 < str < 1000 (In
    javascript you may get slightly more than 1000 in some test cases due to an
    error in the test cases). You do not need to test for this. This is only
    here to tell you that you do not need to worry about your solution timing
    out. #Output The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string. -->
